### Data Quality and Transformation

#### <ins>Data Cleaning and Transformation</ins>
The dataset's preparation involved meticulous cleaning and transformation processes to optimize it for accurate predictive analysis. Key steps undertaken include:

1. **Exclusion of Non-Predictive Variables**:
   - The `id` variable, representing a unique identifier for each house sale, does not contribute to predicting house prices and was therefore removed. This step is crucial in focusing the model on variables that influence the outcome (price).
   - Unlike other non-predictive variables, `lat` (latitude) and `long` (longitude) were initially retained for their crucial role in calculating geographical distances, which could potentially influence house prices.

2. **Transformation of Data Types**:
   - The `date` variable, initially in a string format, was transformed into a numeric format. This conversion is essential for incorporating the date into statistical models, as numeric representations are more amenable to various types of analysis.
   - For variables like `price`, `sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`, etc., necessary conversions were performed to ensure they are in a suitable numeric format.

3. **Creation of Dummy Variables for Categorical Data**:
   - Categorical variables like `waterfront`, `view`, `condition`, and `grade` were transformed into dummy variables. This transformation is pivotal for regression analysis as it allows these non-numeric variables to be effectively included in the model.
   - The process involved converting these categorical variables into a series of binary variables (0 or 1). This is particularly important for variables like `waterfront`, which is a binary indicator itself, and for ordinal variables like `view` and `condition`, which have intrinsic order but need to be numerically represented for modeling.

4. **Handling Special Cases in Variables**:
   - For variables like `bathrooms`, where values like "0.5" represent bathrooms with a toilet but no shower, the data was kept as is, considering these nuances convey important information about the house's characteristics.

5. **Grouping and Clustering of Variables**:
   - The `zipcode` variable was transformed by extracting the first three digits, which helps in reducing the number of dummy variables and preventing the model from becoming overly complex while still capturing the geographical influences on house prices.
   - The `grade` variable was clustered into broader categories to simplify the model and focus on significant differences in construction and design quality.

6. **Haversine Distance Calculation**:
   - To incorporate the influence of location more precisely, the Haversine distance was calculated. This involved creating a function to calculate the distance between two geographical points (latitude and longitude) and applying this to our dataset.
   - The calculation of `haversine_distance` is particularly significant for understanding the spatial relationships and proximity to key locations that might affect house prices.

7. **Calculation of Convergence Point**:
   - The dataset was used to identify a 'convergence point' – a central point derived from houses with the highest values. This point served as a reference to calculate each property's distance from a high-value central location, possibly a marker of a desirable area.
   - This step was critical in ensuring that the model accounts for locational desirability without causing data leakage, as it was based solely on the training set.

```
#### Detailed Explanation for Removal

1. **`sqft_above` & `sqft_living`**: Both variables are highly correlated because the square footage of the living area above ground (`sqft_above`) is part of the total square footage of living space (`sqft_living`). We remove `sqft_above` as it is likely to contain less unique information than the total living space.

2. **`week_of_year`, `day_of_year`, `month_sold`**: These variables are related to the date the house was sold and are thus inherently correlated. `day_of_year` carries the most granular information, so we might prefer to keep it and remove `week_of_year` and `month_sold` which provide more aggregated temporal information.

3. **`condition_4` & `condition_3`**: The condition of the house is a categorical variable that has been one-hot encoded. Since these are mutually exclusive categories, they are negatively correlated. We might decide to keep one category as the reference group and remove the others, or revert to the original categorical variable to capture the overall condition in a single variable.

By removing these variables, we aim to reduce multicollinearity, which can distort the estimated regression coefficients, inflate standard errors, and undermine the statistical significance of the predictors. The goal is to retain the variables that provide the unique and informative contribution to the model's prediction of house prices.

#### Correlation Graphics Analysis

In the table above, we've displayed the top 20 correlation values with the target variable `price`, sorted by their absolute values. Here are some of the key findings:

   1. **Positive Correlations with Price**:
      - Variables such as `sqft_living`, `sqft_above`, `sqft_living15`, and `bathrooms` exhibit strong positive correlations with the target variable. This suggests that as these variables increase, the house price tends to increase as well.
      - Features like `grade_11_13`, `view_4`, and `grade_8_10` also show positive correlations, indicating that higher-grade properties and better views tend to have higher prices.

   2. **Negative Correlations with Price**:
      - No negative correlations are present in the top 20. This means that none of the examined features strongly suggest a decrease in price as they increase.

   3. **Feature Importance**:
      - The strength of the correlations helps us understand the importance of these variables in predicting house prices. Features like `sqft_living` and `grade_11_13` appear to be strong predictors of price.
      - Variables related to location, such as `zipcode_98004`, `zipcode_98039`, and `zipcode_98040`, also have notable positive correlations, indicating the significance of location in price determination.

### Conclusion
This detailed review of the King County house sales dataset underscores the thorough preparation undertaken for the predictive analysis. The dataset's diverse variables, both continuous and categorical, have been meticulously processed and analyzed, providing a robust foundation for developing the predictive model. With the comprehensive EDA and graphical analysis, we gain valuable insights into the correlations and distributions within the data, setting the stage for effective model building and accurate house price prediction.

## III. Model Development Process

Up to this point, we have successfully conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the dataset. We've visualized key features such as price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and more, allowing us to better understand the data's distribution and relationships. Additionally, we've explored various trends, including monthly, seasonal, weekly, and daily trends in both house prices and the count of homes sold. Furthermore, we have cleaned and prepared the data, removing irrelevant variables like `id`, `lat`, and `long` to streamline it for modeling. With these preliminary steps completed, we are now ready to delve into the model development process.

### Initial OLS Model
To commence the model development process, we establish an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model as our baseline. This initial model utilizes the features that have undergone transformation and cleaning during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase. To maintain data quality, enhance model performance, and facilitate interpretability, we begin by removing columns introduced in prior graphical iterations. Additionally, we employ the standard data preprocessing practice of dropping columns with missing values (NA) to ensure dataset integrity. This step ensures that our subsequent analyses and models are built upon a robust and complete dataset, minimizing errors and potential biases.

```{r initial_model, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

### Detailed Inital Model Insights

#### Model Fit
- **R-squared (0.8404)**: Approximately 84.04% of the variability in real estate prices is explained by the model, indicating a strong fit.
- **Adjusted R-squared (0.8393)**: Adjusted for the number of predictors, this value reaffirms the model's effectiveness.

#### Coefficient Analysis
- **Significant Predictors**: Features like `sqft_living`, `waterfront1`, and `bedrooms` have significant coefficients, implying a notable impact on housing prices.
- **Insignificant Predictors**: Variables such as `sqft_lot15` show less significance, suggesting a minor influence on price.

#### Grade Variable Insights
- **Grade Variables**: The negative coefficients for grades (`grade_3` to `grade_12`) compared to a baseline grade (the omitted variable) are intriguing. This suggests that higher grades (implying better quality) are associated with lower prices, which warrants further investigation for data inconsistencies or other underlying factors.

#### Outliers and Residuals
- **Large Residuals**: The considerable spread in residuals (from -1518789 to 3645881) may indicate the presence of outliers or non-linear relationships not captured by the model.

### Next Steps

1. **Multicollinearity Check**: We will calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each predictor to identify multicollinearity, which can inflate the variance of the estimated regression coefficients and make the model less reliable.

```{r inital_model_vif_examinaiton}
print(vif(linear_model_initial))
```

**Explanation**: In this section, we load the necessary libraries for modeling, including `lmtest` and `car`. We then use the `lm()` function to create the initial OLS regression model, where we predict the `price` based on all available features in the `train_df` dataset. The `summary()` function provides detailed information about the model, including coefficients, significance levels, and goodness-of-fit statistic# Feature Evaluation
After constructing the initial model, we proceed with feature evaluation. This step involves investigating the importance of each predictor in the model. We assess the significance of individual variables and consider whether to remove or combine categorical variables to optimize model performance. The R code below demonstrates how to evaluate the importance of features:

```{r feature_evaluation, echo = TRUE}
predictions <- predict(linear_model_initial, newdata = test_df_linear)

# Assuming 'actual_values' is the actual target variable values in your test dataset
actual_values <- test_df_linear$price

# Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
mae <- mean(abs(predictions - actual_values))

# Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((predictions - actual_values)^2))

# Calculate R-squared (R2)
residuals <- actual_values - predictions
ss_total <- sum((actual_values - mean(actual_values))^2)
ss_residual <- sum(residuals^2)
r2 <- 1 - (ss_residual / ss_total)

# Print the evaluation metrics
cat("MAE:", mae, "\n")
cat("RMSE:", rmse, "\n")
cat("R-squared:", r2, "\n")
```

**Explanation**: In this section, we perform feature evaluation using stepwise selection. This technique automatically evaluates the significance of each predictor and iteratively selects the most relevant variables for the model. The `step()` function optimizes the model by adding or removing variables based on their significance levels. The resulting `stepwise_model` provides insights into the final set of predictors and their impact on model performance.
